## 3D Vision Coursework 2: 3D Reconstruction ('23-24)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the 3D Vision Coursework 2, focusing on developing a 3D reconstruction pipeline using OpenCV in C++. It involves creating a dataset simulating a mobile platform's path and applying sequential SfM and stereovision frameworks. Includes point-cloud processing and visualization techniques.
