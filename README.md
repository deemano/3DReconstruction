This is the repository for the 3D Vision Coursework 2 - 3D Reconstruction ('23-24).

# ===========================================
   CONSOLE APPLICATION # 3D Reconstruction
  ===========================================
  
## 📝 Features in progress: 

    1. Collecting Image Data for a Robotics Scene:
    Ex. simulate the path of a mobile platform moving through a space, etc;
    2. Data Fusion - Using Additional Sensors (GPS, IMU, LiDAR, etc);
    3. Developing the 3D Reconstruction:
    -  extract 3D information from the 2D images;
    -  sequential SfM or stereovision;
    4. Creating a 3D Point Cloud:
    -  point-cloud techniques such as noise filtering, smoothing, creating a mesh surface, or applying texture.
    5. Documentation and Reporting:
    -  Work report;
    -  GitHub repo   ✓
